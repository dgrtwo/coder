\title{Classcodes for Elixhauser based on ICD-codes}
\format{A data frame with 31 rows and 8 variables:
\describe{
  \item{group}{comorbidity groups}
  \item{regex}{regular expressions identifying ICD-10 codes of each group}
  \item{regex_short}{regular expressions identifying only the first three
  characters of ICD-10 codes of each group. This alternative version was
  added for comparison. There are good no reasons to use this version
  instead of 'regex'!}
  \item{sum_all}{all weights = 1. This is included for convenience when
  calculating several indices simultaneously}
  \item{sum_all_ahrq}{as \code{sum_all} excluding "cardiac arrhythmias"}
  \item{walraven}{weights suggested by Walraven et al (2009)}
  \item{sid29}{weights suggested by Thompson et al. (2015)
    based on all conditions except cardiac arrhythmias}
  \item{sid30}{weights suggested by Thompson et al. (2015)
    based on all conditions}
 \item{ahrq_mort}{weights for in-hospital mortality suggested by
   Moore et al. (2017)}
 \item{ahrq_readm}{weights for readmissions suggested by
   Moore et al. (2017)}

\code{elix.short_icd10} is just for testing and should not be used
in practice! (It is based only on the first three code positions of ICD-10.)
