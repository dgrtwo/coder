Title: Classification of Cases into Deterministic Categories
Version: 0.2.5
Author: Erik Bulow
Maintainer: Erik Bulow <eriklgb@gmail.com>
Description: Functionality of the package relies on three central objects.
  1) A data frame with objects (for example patients) to classify.
  2) A data frame with codes (for example ICD-10-codes) for each object
  (patient) valid at distinct time points.
  3) A classification scheme (a 'classcodes' object) defining the
  classification based on regular expressions.
  Some 'classcodes' objects are included in the package (for patients
  based on their ICD-10-codes for Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidity indices,
  RxRisk-V, adverse events for patients with Total Hip Arthroplasty
  and more).
  It is also easy to introduce new classification schemes to use with arbitrary
  code data.
  The package works in two implicit versions: a bare bone version without any
  additional packages required, and  a faster version relying on suggested
  packages, producing the same results but considerably faster
  (higly recommended for large data sets).
  All functions are designed to fit nicely within the 'tidyverse'
  (aka 'hadleyverse').
