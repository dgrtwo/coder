Title: Classification of Cases into Deterministic Categories
Version: 0.4.4
Author: Erik Bulow
Maintainer: Erik Bulow <eriklgb@gmail.com>
Description: Functionality of the package relies on three central objects.
  1) A data frame with objects (for example patients) to classify.
  2) A data frame with codes (for example ICD-10-codes) for each object
  (patient) valid at distinct time points.
  3) A classification scheme (a 'classcodes' object) defining the
  classification based on regular expressions.
  Some 'classcodes' objects are included in the package (for patients
  based on their ICD-10-codes for Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidity indices,
  RxRisk-V, adverse events for patients with Total Hip Arthroplasty
  and more).
  It is easy to introduce new classification schemes to use with arbitrary
  code data.
