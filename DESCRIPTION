Title: Classification of Cases into Deterministic Categories
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Erik Bulow
Maintainer: Erik Bulow <eriklgb@gmail.com>
Description: Classification of cases into distinct categories using
  classification ('classcodes') tables.
  Includes some tables and functions to classify patients using ICD-10-codes for
  Charlson, Elixhauser, RxRisk-V and more.
  It is also easy to introduce new classification tables to use with arbitrary
  code data.
  The package works in two implicit versions: a bare bone version without any
  additional packages required, and  a faster version relying on suggested
  packages, producing the same results but considerably faster
  (higly recommended for large data sets).
  All functions are designed to fit in with 'tidyverse' (aka 'hadleyverse').
