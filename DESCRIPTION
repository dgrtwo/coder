Title: Classification of Cases into Deterministic Categories
Version: 0.5.0
Author: Erik Bulow
Maintainer: Erik Bulow <eriklgb@gmail.com>
Description: Functionality of the package relies on three central objects.
  1) A data frame with objects (for example patients) to classify.
  2) A data frame with codes (for example 'ICD'-10-codes) for each object
  (patient) valid at distinct time points.
  3) A classification scheme (a 'classcodes' object) defining the
  classification based on regular expressions.
  It is easy to introduce new classification schemes to use with arbitrary
  code data and some default 'classcodes' objects are included in the package.
