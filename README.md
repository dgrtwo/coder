The goal of `coder` is to classify items from one dataset, using codes
from a secondary source with classification schemes based on regular
expressions and weighted indices. Default classification schemes
(classcodes objects) are focused on patients classified by diagnoses,
comorbidities, adverse events and medications.

## Installation

You can (soon) install the released version of coder from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
# install.packages("coder") # Not yet!
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("eribul/coder")
```

## Usage

Assume we have some patients with corresponding dates of interest:

``` r
library(coder)
knitr::kable(head(ex_people))
```

| name                    | event      |
| :---------------------- | :--------- |
| Miller, Von Buddenbrock | 2019-07-15 |
| Enriquez, Anthony       | 2019-12-27 |
| al-Dib, Farhaan         | 2020-02-22 |
| Martinez, Alison        | 2019-11-29 |
| el-Masri, Junaid        | 2019-09-17 |
| Sam, Niki               | 2020-03-05 |

We also have some external medical data (ICD-10-codes recorded at
previous hospital):

``` r
knitr::kable(head(ex_icd10))
```

| id                 | code\_date | code    | hdia  |
| :----------------- | :--------- | :------ | :---- |
| Aguilera, Brandon  | 2019-07-29 | O350XX9 | TRUE  |
| Aguilera, Brandon  | 2019-10-23 | S55101A | TRUE  |
| Aguilera, Brandon  | 2019-11-23 | A4181   | TRUE  |
| Alexander, Bethany | 2019-04-08 | S62126K | FALSE |
| Alexander, Bethany | 2019-05-13 | I70718  | FALSE |
| Alexander, Bethany | 2019-09-17 | O368124 | FALSE |

Using those two sources, as well as a classification scheme (see below),
we can easily identify all Charlson co-morbidities during one year prior
to the event of interest.

``` r
ch <- 
  categorize(
    head(ex_people), ex_icd10, "charlson",
    id = "name",
    index = c("quan_original", "quan_updated"),
    codify_args = list(date = "event", days = c(-365, -1))
  )
#> Classification based on: regex_icd10
```

The result is a dataset with columns for each comorbidity and (optional)
each weighted index (quan\_original and quan\_updated):

``` r
knitr::kable(
  dplyr::select(ch, name, quan_original, quan_updated) 
)
```

| name                    | quan\_original | quan\_updated |
| :---------------------- | -------------: | ------------: |
| Enriquez, Anthony       |              0 |             0 |
| Martinez, Alison        |              0 |             0 |
| Miller, Von Buddenbrock |             NA |            NA |
| Sam, Niki               |              1 |             0 |
| al-Dib, Farhaan         |              0 |             0 |
| el-Masri, Junaid        |              0 |             0 |

## Classification schemes

Classification schemes (`classcodes` objects) are based on regular
expressions for computational speed, but their content can be summarized
and visualized for clarity. Arbitrary `classcodes` objects can also be
specified by the user.

### Default classcodes

The package includes default `classcodes` for medical patient data based
on the international classification of diseases version 8, 9 and 10
(ICD-8/9/10), as well as the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical
Classification System (ATC) for medical prescription data.

Default `classcades` are listed in the table. Each classification
(classcodes column) can be based on several code systems (regex column)
and have several alternative weighted indices (indices column). Those
might be combined freely.

| classcodes      | regex                                                                                   | indices                                                                                                                    |

# Relation to other packages

`coder` uses `data.table` as a backend to increase computational speed
for large datasets. There are some R packages with a narrow focus on
Charlson and Elixhauser co-morbidity based on ICD-codes
([icd](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=icd),
[comorbidity](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=comorbidity),
[medicalrisk](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=medicalrisk),
[comorbidities.icd10](https://github.com/gforge/comorbidities.icd10),
[icdcoder](https://github.com/wtcooper/icdcoder)). The `coder` package
includes similar functionalities but has a wider scope.
